    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <h2>I am Hugh Baldwin</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of Portsmouth.
        Most of my current work is open source and publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am most interested in embedded programming and graphics development, and as such I am learning C++ and creating projects using the Raspberry Pi Pico

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/HughTB/picoled">PicOLED</a></h2>
        <p>
            PicOLED is a small USB/serial display which can be connected to a computer to show important information, such as CPU or memory usage (More to come in the future!). It is written entirely in C++ and <i>should</i> run on any RP2040-based microcontroller with an I<span class="superscript">2</span>C interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the PicOLED device itself is fully functional, and just waiting for a complete <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/picoled-driver">driver</a> to be developed. I am currently in the process of creating the Linux version of said driver, and so far it supports sending memory and CPU usage on all systems, and partial temperature information on specific systems (8th Gen Intel systems). Whether a Windows driver will be created remains to be seen (I'm scared of <code>windows.h</code>)

        <p>
            Minima is a URL shortening API written in Dart. It's not overly complex but is a good introduction to creating APIs using Dart & Shelf (There's also a little bit of file I/O)

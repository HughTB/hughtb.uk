        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        
        <p>I'm Hugh, a final year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Portsmouth

        <p>I love working with hardware, developing software, tinkering with my homelab and messing about with Linux on my personal machine. Most of my work (that's not under grading or licence restrictions) is open-source on <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/">Github</a>

        <h1><a href="https://train-tracked.com/">Train Tracked</a></h1>

        <p>Created as a Level 5 project @UoP, A Better&trade; UK train tracking app which uses National Rail Enquiries' <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds/">Darwin&trade; API</a>. Built with Flutter on the frontend, Dart & Shelf on the backend.

        <p>The backend acts as a proxy between the mobile app and Darwin. It's main purpose to convert from the legacy SOAP API that is Darwin to a more up-to-date and reliable REST API. It also improves the reliability of requests as SOAP relies heavily on keeping a connection open for the duration of the request, including while it processes the request and fetches data from other sources, which is not always feasible on the type of connection people may be using on a train (i.e. very poor cellular data in the middle of the countryside). There is also more filtering done before passing the request to Darwin, as it has no innate validation -- it doesn't check dates, times, station CRS codes or train RIDs -- and simply returns a 500 if any data is not accepted.

        <h1>Homelab</h1>
        
        <p>My personal homelab, which you're currently using to view this website!

        <p>Currently made up of 2 Lenovo ThinkCenter 'Tiny' PCs (1x M700 & 1x M720q) running Proxmox. They currently run a few publicly accessible services (this website, and the backends for a few of my personal and University projects) as well as private services such as a VPN, media server and a couple of game servers.

        <h1><a href="https://github.com/HughTB/picoled">picOLED</a></h1>

        <p>A small (<1") OLED display and RP2040-based microcontroller which can be connected to a computer to display important stats.

        <p>Both the device's firmware and the Linux driver are written in C++, using CMake to manage dependencies. The statistics are gathered by the driver and then sent over a serial connection to the device, which interprets and displays the data. While work on this project has temporarily paused (if I have more time in the future) it is definitely a project I want to finish and get to the point of being what I would consider to be "fully functional", as far as what my original plans were (And possibly expand upon them using a WiFi enabled microcontroller...)

        <h1><a href="https://github.com/HughTB/minima-dart">Minima</a></h1>

        <p>A URL "shortening" API.

        <p>Minima was created for the simple purpose of learning to use Shelf in Dart -- somewhat like a "Hello World" project in any new language. It is a fairly basic API, simply checking if the provided link already exists in the database, and randomly generating a new 6 letter code if not. The "database" consists of a CSV file, meaning that link data is stored as plain text, but must be URL-encoded before storing to make sure the link doesn't break the file encoding.

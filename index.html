    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <h2>I am Hugh Baldwin</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of Portsmouth.
        Most of my current work is open source and publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am most interested in embedded programming and graphics development, and as such I am learning C++ and creating projects using the Raspberry Pi Pico

        <h2><a href="https://train-tracked.com">Train Tracked</a></h2>
        <p>
            Train Tracked is a "better" UK train tracking app, created as part of a Level 5 Computer Science project at the University of Portsmouth
        </p>
        <p>
            Developed using Dart, Flutter and the Rail Delivery Group's delightful <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds/">Darwin API</a>.
            As well as the app itself, I have also developed an <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/train-tracked-api/">API</a> which sits between Darwin and the app, which handles converting an XML SOAP API to a much nicer JSON REST API, as well as some basic parsing

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/HughTB/picoled">picOLED</a></h2>
        <p>
            picOLED is a small USB serial display which can be connected to a computer to show important information, such as CPU or memory usage (More to come in the future!). It is written entirely in C++ and <i>should</i> run on any RP2040-based microcontroller with an I<span class="superscript">2</span>C interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the device itself is fully functional, but waiting for a complete driver to be written. 
            I am in the process of writing the <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/picoled-driver">Linux version</a> of this driver, which has at the time of writing, support for CPU and Memory usage, CPU temperature (On certain platforms, namely Intel 8th Gen and AMD Zen 2 CPUs) and GPU temperature (On RDNA 2 AMD GPUs).
            A Windows driver may come into existence in the future, but this is a low priority to me as I do not anticipate anyone using this project other than myself, who uses Linux for my main desktop computer.

        <h2>TB-69</h2>
        <p>
            TB-69 is a 69% (nice) ISO hand-wired keyboard of my own design. The chassis was desgined using Fusion 360 and 3D printed.
            I am currently in the process of wiring the keyboard, which is proving to be more difficult than I was expecting due to the small size of connections and the inadequacy of my cheapo uncontrolled soldering iron

        <h2><a href="https://minima.hughtb.uk/">Minima</a></h2>
        <p>
            Minima is a URL shortening API written in Dart. It's not overly complex but is a good introduction to creating APIs using Dart & Shelf (There's also a little bit of file I/O)

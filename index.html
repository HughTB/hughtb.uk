      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Hugh, a second year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Portsmouth
      </p>
      <p>
        I love working on both hardware and software, tinkering with my homelab, and messing about with Linux on my (slightly janky) setup.
        Most of my work is open-source on Github
      </p>

        <h2>Homelab</h2>
        <p>
          Personal homelab, which currenly consists of 2 Lenovo 'Tiny' PCs (1x M700 &amp; 1x M720q) running Proxmox. They run a few publically
          accessible services (this website, and a few of my other projects), as well as game servers and a media server

    <a href="https://minima.hughtb.uk/"><h2>Minima</h2></a>
    <p>
      Minima is a URL shortening API written in Dart. It's not overly complex but is a good introduction to creating APIs using Dart &amp; Shelf (There's also a little bit of file I/O)
    </p>
    <p>
      Source code available on <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/minima-dart/">Github</a> (Last updated 2023-05-10)

    <h2>TB-69</h2>
    <p>
      TB-69 is a 69% (nice) ISO hand-wired keyboard of my own design. The chassis was desgined using Fusion 360 and 3D printed.
      I am currently in the process of wiring the keyboard, which is proving to be more difficult than I was expecting due to the small size of connections and the inadequacy of my cheapo uncontrolled soldering iron

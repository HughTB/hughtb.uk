    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <h2>I am Hugh Baldwin</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a 1st year Computer Science student at the University of Portsmouth.
        Most of my current work is open source and publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm currently learning Dart for Uni and C(++) recreationally, but have previous experience in Python and C#.
        I hope to dig into more advanced topics, such as 3D graphics and embedded development in the near future

        <h2><a href="https://minima.hughtb.uk/">Minima</a></h2>
        <p>Minima is a URL shortening API written in Dart. It's not overly complex but is a good introduction to creating APIs using Dart & Shelf (There's also a little bit of file I/O)</p>
        <p>You can view the source code on <a href="http://github.com/HughTB/minima-dart/">GitHub</a> (Last updated 2023-05-07)</p>
